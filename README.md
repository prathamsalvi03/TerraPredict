"Landslide prediction and analyzing"

This project works on two aspects :-
   1) Prediction = Model has been trained on satellite images based on dataset provide during the Landslide4Sense challenge .
   2) Analysing = Model is trained on UAV images of landslide acquired from opensource and tested on real time videos of landslide taken using UAV .

Method :
Semantic Segmentation is used to perform the above two tasks .
